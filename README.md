RescueChest
===========

Rescue Chest is a spiritual successor to Save Point Chest created by bigdre88ap.  See http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/452163-125smp-save-point-chest-140/ for more information about the mod I used for inspiration.

This minecraft mod allows you to create a special rescue chest that will magically store your armor and items when you die.  No more frantically running back to the nether to try to save the few items that didn't fall into lava!!

This is my first mod and as such is supplied without warranty of any kind.  Back up your worlds before installing it and I suggest you do not try it out by jumping into the biggest lava lake you can find.
